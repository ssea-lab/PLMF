This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant No. 2017YFB1400602. To carry out the study of the online QoS (Quality of Service) prediction [1], we use the following dataset.

# Dataset
**4500 x 140 x 64 time-aware Web service QoS dataset**
This dataset describes real-world QoS evaluation results from 140 users on 4,500 Web services over 64 consecutive time slices (at 15-minute interval), which is created based on the raw observations of [WSDream](https://github.com/wsdream/wsdream-dataset) by removing users with extremely sparse data and adding side-information of users and services. Most of users and services have geographic location information (some of them may be inaccurate). The dataset can be retrived by contacting jianwang@whu.edu.cn.
